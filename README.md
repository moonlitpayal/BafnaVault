**BafnaVault** is a secure, cross-platform Document Management System (DMS) designed to centralize and protect internal company assets. Built to replace inefficient paper workflows, it ensures that critical blueprints, contracts, and financial documents are accessible securely from anywhere.

## 💡 The Problem & Solution

**The Challenge:**
During my internship, I observed that critical documents were scattered across physical files and local hard drives. This led to version conflicts, security risks, and slow retrieval times.

**My Solution:**
I architected a **centralized cloud "Vault"**.
* **Secure:** Sensitive files are protected by a custom 2-layer passkey system.
* **Fast:** Real-time search finds documents in milliseconds.
* **Ubiquitous:** Works seamlessly on the Site Engineer's phone and the Office Manager's desktop.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🔐 1. Advanced Security Architecture
* **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Admin vs. Viewer roles via Firebase Auth.
* **The "Double-Lock" System:** Even after logging in, opening a confidential file requires a specific **6-digit dynamic passkey**.

### 📂 2. Smart Organization & Archiving
* **Project-Centric View:** Files are isolated by project folders (e.g., "Orchid Residency").
* **The Archive Vault:** Completed projects move to a separate 'Archive' section, keeping the main dashboard clean while preserving historical data.

### 👁️‍🗨️ 3. Integrated Document Preview
* **Built-in Viewer:** Preview PDFs and images directly within the app without downloading external files, enhancing speed and security.

### ⚡ 4. High-Performance Workflow
* **Cross-Platform Sync:** Instant synchronization between Desktop uploads and Mobile views.
* **Instant Filtering:** Client-side search logic allows users to filter through thousands of documents instantly.
